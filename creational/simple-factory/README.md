## Simple Factory (Creational Pattern)

### Description

A simple factory generates an instance for the client without exposing any instantiation logic to the client.

### When to use?

If object creation is complex, involving multiple steps or intricate logic, we can encapsulate this creation logic 
in a separate factory to avoid repetition.
